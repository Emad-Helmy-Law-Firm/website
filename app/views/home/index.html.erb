              At a critical time of conflict and need for affirmative actions and precise evaluations of the minutiae of the situation,  reaching out to Mr. Emad Helmy was the best course of action we could have taken. His endless patience for listening to lengthy details & history and his ability to be completely involved in every aspect of the case and yet at the same time retain enough detachment to enable him to propose, explain and convince us of a precise course of action showed strong leadership and was, at the same time, both reassuring and comforting. 
              But most commendable of all was his willingness to change course as events developed and to explore alternate routes of diplomacy and conflict resolution. 
              We value the friendship that developed during the time of working on the case and are very lucky and proud to be represented by him and to be able to depend on him in all matters that require legal as well as corporate expertise.

              Writing a letter of recommendation is hard work, but it can be a highly rewarding activity if it greatly affects the lives of many people by helping them gain the opportunity of being introduced to an excellent lawyer, who can be of great help in advising those people of what to do in critical situations they may encounter. Emad is an extremely competent lawyer. 
              He certainly has, among many other things, precision, structure, rigor, logic obviously, 
              and consistency.<br>
              Emad is a very thorough professional who always had my best interests in mind. 
              He is really honest and straightforward about informing me what should be done calmly and persuasively. He is patient enough to explain to me the pros and cons of every idea I propose, and gives me a lot of space to make my own choices. But he always intervenes in the right moment, if I am about to do something reckless, or not well investigated or/and studied from the pure legal point of view.
              So in a nut shell Emad is firm but utterly persuasive, patient and extremely competent, and finally honest and only concerned with my real benefit. As it happened, all his decisions (so far) have been the right ones. He does have the intuition of an extremely good lawyer. His decisions are always based to serve my policies in whatever matter by carefully selecting the most appropriate procedures.
              Since appointing Emad as my regular lawyer, I always felt that my legal rights in any matter were in very good hands. Emad is extremely punctual, never missed a scheduled meeting and he always took my calls. What I especially liked about Emad was his ability to remain calm in crisis situations.
              Emad became a key and integral part of my work (and any buisness I happen to engage in) and I owe a debt of gratitude to him for his service.
              I have absolutely no reservations to generate this recommendation letter for him. Emad is a solid lawyer who practices nothing but the best customer service methods.<br>
              Emad owns a firm with many competent mostly young lawyers. Each one of those lawyers is competent in his area of interest or specialization. The ones I dealt with among his team of lawyers are comfortable managing legal files, preparing and negotiating contracts, and performing an array of office tasks. 
              Some have acquired exceptional administrative skills, acting as de facto go between for clients on a regular basis. They all have the descipline of communicational and inter-personnel skills to support colleagues and clients.
              To conclude Emad is a dedicated, conscientious, reliable Lawyer, having an equally competent team, and I strongly recommend him as a competent Lawyer for any one who faces any legal problems, particularly intricate ones needing unconventional approaches and a lot of ingenuity.
